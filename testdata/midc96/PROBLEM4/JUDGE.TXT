1996 ACM MID-CENTRAL REGIONAL PROGRAMMING CONTEST
PROBLEM #4 - BOARD SILLY

JUDGE'S NOTES

This problem allows the list of valid moves to be output in any order.
For this reason this problem should not be judged with a text
comparison utility but rather by visual inspection.

Regional Chief Judge
