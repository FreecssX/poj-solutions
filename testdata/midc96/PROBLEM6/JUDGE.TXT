1996 ACM MID-CENTRAL REGIONAL PROGRAMMING CONTEST
PROBLEM #6 - EQUATION ELATION

JUDGE'S NOTES

This problem specifically states that the spacing in the output is NOT
critical.  Therefore, the solution to this problem should not be
judged using a text comparision utility, but rather by visual
inspection.
